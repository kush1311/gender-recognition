# Face Gender Recognition

This repository contains code for real-time gender recognition using face detection and pre-trained models. The `opencv` library is used for face detection, and a pre-trained model is loaded to classify the detected faces as male or female.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- Keras

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/kush1311/face-recognition`
2. Path of dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maciejgronczynski/biggest-genderface-recognition-dataset
3. Run the script: (1) `python train_data.py` (2) python main.py
4. The webcam feed will open, and the script will detect faces and classify them as male or female in real-time.
